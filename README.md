🔧 Upwork API Support Bot
A RAG-powered Technical Support AI that answers developer questions about
the Upwork API — built as part of the Associate AI Developer take-home assignment
for the ProAnalyst AI team.

📌 What It Does
Developers often struggle to find quick, accurate answers inside large API
reference documents. This bot solves that by:

Reading the official Upwork API documentation PDF
Breaking it into searchable vector chunks stored locally
Retrieving only the most relevant sections for each question
Generating a grounded, hallucination-resistant answer via a hosted LLM

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/upwork-api-bot.git
cd upwork-api-bot
2. Install dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up your API key
bashcp .env.example .env
# Open .env and set:  DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=your_key_here
4. Build the vector store (run once)
bashpython ingest.py --pdf API_Documentation_Partial.pdf
5. Launch the app
bashstreamlit run app.py

💬 Example Questions

"How long is an OAuth access token valid for?"
"How do I obtain an authorization code using the Authorization Code Grant?"
"Can I use a Client Credentials Grant to access a user's private contract details?"
"What HTTP status code does GraphQL return on a validation error?"


🔐 Security

API keys are never hardcoded — loaded from .env at runtime
.env and chroma_db/ are excluded via .gitignore
Embeddings run locally — no document content is sent to external servers
